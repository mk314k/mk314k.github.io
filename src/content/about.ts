    main: `Hi! I’m Kartikesh, an MEng student in MIT’s EECS Department specializing in AI and Machine Learning. My current research focuses on inverse problem in imaging applications, 
            where I combine plug-and-play solvers, CNN-based denoisers, and reinforcement learning techniques. I’m especially interested in meta-learning and interpretability 
            for vision and language models, aiming to understand patterns that support highly generalized learning. My academic interests also include analysis, probability, 
            software design, and philosophy.`,
    para: [
        `Beyond my studies, I’ve enjoyed teaching and mentoring. I’ve been a teaching assistant at MIT for Machine Learning and Advanced Computer Vision,
        and for two summers, I mentored high school students in AI and ML through MIT’s Momentum AI Club.`,
        `In my free time, I work on various AI/ML and software projects, many of which you can explore here. Recent projects include 
        “Pyssemble,” a Python-Assembly debugging tool, and “R3DVAE-GAN,” which combines transformer-based attention with VAE-GANs to generate 3D images.
        `,
        `If you’re interested in MetaLearning, AI safety or ML applications especially in EdTech, feel free to connect—I’m always open to new ideas, discussions and collaborations.`
