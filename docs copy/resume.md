Created custom data structure for document pages using underlying geometric bounds to speed up the parser model by 10 times
Designed a deep learning architecture, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow for Devanagari and English text recognition
ML Lab Assistant, Intro to Machine Learning							January 2022 - May 2022
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department, MIT					Cambridge, MA
Supervised a collaborative group session of 50 students in weekly interactive ML labs and examined their lab assignment progress
Held weekly office hours to help students understand ML content such as neural networks, decision trees, reinforcement learning, and more
Undergraduate Research Assistant									 June 2021 - Dec 2021
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), MIT					Cambridge, MA
Developed a ROS program to auto-collect data from various sensors (including camera) for DJI Matrix 300 drones
Built a ROS framework in a team of 3 to allow a single code run in both Flightmare Simulator and physical drone
Developed drone autonomy software for autonomous flight with velocity control and path planning
Projects
Inpainting | C++, Python
Implemented conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithm for deblurring images; solved poison equations and used CGD for image composition (overlaying an image over another). See the source on GitHub
EQT | Typescript, Figma, node.js, express.js, HTML, CSS, SQL
Developed a full-stack education platform to match students with tutors; designed a mathematical model to balance resources for students with diverse economic statuses. See the source on GitHub
ReKnew ( Projecting Past Memories on Real Life Objects) | Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe
Designed an algorithm using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect targeted objects through the camera and augment our memories image on it
R3DVAE-GAN | Python, Pytorch, VAE, GAN, Attention
Augmented attention blocks in variational autoencoders and combined them with a generative adversarial network; trained them on dataset ShapeNetCore to learn 3d shapes from a single 2d image. See GitHub.
Chess | Python, C++, Arduino, SQLite, HTTP
A server-based chess engine allows two users across the globe to play using Arduino controlled Lcd display, taking inputs through buttons
